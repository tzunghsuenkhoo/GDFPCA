# GDFPCA

This R package implements the generalized dynamic functional principal component analysis
(GDFPCA). GDFPCA is an extension of the generalized dynamic principal component analysis by Peña and Yohai (2016) in the functional data context. 
The function GDFPCA calculates the estimated generalized dynamic principal components (GDPCs) and 
approximate a functional process using the estimated GDPCs.
